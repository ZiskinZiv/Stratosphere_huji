## Stratospheric water vapor reconsturction tools using ML methods
This repository is used mainly to reconstruct and analyze the Stratospheric water vapor using traditional Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and various more non-linear Machine Learning (ML) models.
<!---
For now, we have one project ready to be published:
### The roles of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and El Niño for entry Stratospheric water vapour

#### Project description
There are two major processes that control the Stratospheric water vapor concentrations: The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this project, we re-evaluate their relative importance in the observations and in comprehensive coupled ocean-atmosphere-chemistry models. We use MLR and three additional ML models to explore the possibility of nonlinear interactions between these two predictors. This project is yet to be published, however we can show some example figures:

#### Example of feature importances in a linear regression model (MLR) employed on the world map

The β coefficients for the water vapor anomalies MLR analysis in the 82.54 hPa level from 2005 to 2019.

#### Example of time series reconstruction using linear regression models (MLR) and other ML models

Out of sample model predictions of deseasonalized and standardized equitorial water vapor at 82.54 hPa. The various models are RF (blue), SVM (orange), MLP (green) and MLR (red). The observations are from SWOOSH (purple). Note the three forecast "busts":2010-D-2011-JFM, 2015-OND and 2016-OND.
